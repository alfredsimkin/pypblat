{"name":"Pblat","tagline":"parallelized blat with multi-threads support","body":"### Welcome to pblat\r\nWhen the query file format is fasta, you can specify many threads to process it.\r\nIt can reduce run time linearly, and use almost equal memory as the original blat\r\nprogram. This is useful when you blat a big query file to a huge reference like\r\nhuman whole genome sequence.\r\n\r\nThe program is based on the original blat program which was written by Jim Kent.\r\n\r\npblat can run on **Linux** and **Mac OS**.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Install\r\nTo compile the source code, simply enter the source code directory in terminal\r\nand issue the make command.\r\n```\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Run\r\nTo run with multiple threads, add option \"-threads=<number of threads>\" in the\r\ncommand line.\r\n```\r\n$ pblat -threads=<int> [other options] <database.fasta> <query.fasta> <out.psl>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\npblat is modified from blat, the licence is the same as blat.
